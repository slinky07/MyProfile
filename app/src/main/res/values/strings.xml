    <string name="AboutMeText"> My name is Sir Francis Sauve the 4th, Duke of Saint-Anicet. I come from along line of farmers and maple-syrup makers, no cap. There is great responsibility being the future head of the family Maple Syrup-making business. I came into computer science to help bring to the cloud this business. My dream to open the first Maple-Syrup business entirely on the cloud and to sell them as NFT. Generations from now, people will still be talking about Sir Francis Sauve the 4th, Duke of Saint Anicet, who has revolutionized the maple-syrup business.</string>
